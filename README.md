# cinema
Project using React.Js with a database to store info about movies.
First step, Build the front end then set up postgres database with node.js


I'm afraid I've been very busy and haven't had that much time to work on this, I'll try to update it fast but time isn't really on my side.
Either way, the app shows a functionality between front end and back end but slight glitch on the front end, will fix later... hopefully I have time soon.
