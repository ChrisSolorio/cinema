Project using React.Js with a database to store info about movies.
First step, Build the front end then set up postgres database with node.js


The app shows a functionality between front end (React.js) and back end (Node.js) with a postgres database. After entries are created into the database the user can access a page for the movie.
The great thing about this project is the ability to build upon what I have. Everything I made I did with the intention of adding features for the future. Users can be added who can in turn rate movies that are added into a database of movies every user can access. If time allows I will add this but as of now this is meant to show a foundation for an application where movie information can be stored, updated, and accessed.

To run you need postgres, node.js, and react installed in your computer. 

Navigate to /server/database.sql run file in postgres (you need to install postgres and log in to your admin account in the command terminal to run this file)

Then run /server/index.js using "node index.js"

Then navigate to /cinema and run using npm start
